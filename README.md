# RL PROJECT: Train Capacity Management Game

A Gymnasium-compliant reinforcement learning environment for training agents to manage train capacity in a realistic transit system simulation.

## 🎯 Overview

This project implements a train capacity management game based on Manila's LRT-2 line, where RL agents learn to balance:
- **Passenger boarding** (maximize)
- **Capacity efficiency** (minimize waste)
- **Infrastructure stress** (prevent collapse)
- **Configuration costs** (minimize expansions)

## ✅ Fixed Issues (Comprehensive Review)

### **Critical Fixes Applied:**

1. **✅ Gymnasium API Compliance**
   - `step()` now returns 5-tuple: `(obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info)`
   - `reset()` now returns 2-tuple: `(obs, info)`
   - Action and observation spaces are attributes (not properties)
   - Added proper `render_mode` support

2. **✅ Reward Double-Counting Bug Fixed**
   - Configuration cost was being subtracted twice
   - Now applied only once in `step_reward` calculation

3. **✅ Consistent State Space**
   - 6-dimensional state: `[capacity, passengers, station_idx, direction, hour, minute]`
   - All files updated to use the same dimensions

4. **✅ Info Dictionary Consistency**
   - Standardized structure across all code paths
   - Includes: alighted, boarded, arrivals, penalties, efficiency metrics

5. **✅ Agent Implementations Updated**
   - Fixed Gymnasium API compatibility in all training loops
   - Updated Q-Learning, Monte Carlo, and Actor-Critic agents

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Activate the conda environment with gymnasium
conda activate pt1
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from train_game_env import TrainGameEnv

# Create environment
env = TrainGameEnv(initial_capacity=100, seed=42)

# Reset environment
obs, info = env.reset()

# Take a step
action = env.action_space.sample()  # or 0, 1, 2
obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

# Get final score
if terminated or truncated:
    normalized_score, raw_score = env.final_score()
    print(f"Final Score: {normalized_score}/100")
```

## 📊 Environment Specification

### Action Space
- **Type:** `Discrete(3)`
- **Actions:**
  - `0`: Add carriage (+100 capacity, cost=10, weight=1.0)
  - `1`: Widen carriage (+50 capacity, cost=5, weight=0.5)
  - `2`: No action (cost=0, weight=0)

### Observation Space
- **Type:** `Box(6,)` with dtype `float32`
- **Dimensions:**
  1. `capacity`: Current train capacity [0, ∞)
  2. `passengers_onboard`: Current passengers [0, ∞)
  3. `station_idx`: Current station [0, 12]
  4. `direction`: Travel direction {-1, 1}
  5. `hour`: Current hour [0, 23]
  6. `minute`: Current minute [0, 59]

### Reward Structure

```python
reward = boarding_reward - efficiency_penalty - config_penalty

where:
  boarding_reward = 1.5 × passengers_boarded
  efficiency_penalty = calculated based on unused capacity and time
  config_penalty = 2.0 × action_cost
```

### Termination Conditions
- **Terminated:** Infrastructure collapse or end of operating hours (22:00)
- **Truncated:** Maximum steps reached (2000)

## 🤖 Training RL Agents

The project includes three RL algorithms:

1. **Monte Carlo** (tabular, first-visit)
2. **Q-Learning** (tabular, off-policy)
3. **Actor-Critic** (neural network, policy gradient)

### Running Training

Open `rl_training.ipynb` in Jupyter:

```bash
conda activate pt1
jupyter notebook rl_training.ipynb
```

Or run cells directly to train agents.

## 🔧 Key Design Decisions

### Why These Fixes Matter

1. **Gymnasium Compliance**: Enables use with Stable-Baselines3, RLlib, and other standard RL libraries
2. **Reward Fixes**: Ensures agents can actually learn (previous double-penalty made learning nearly impossible)
3. **State Consistency**: Prevents crashes and confusion across different code versions
4. **Proper API**: Follows RL community standards for environment design

### Reward Design Philosophy

The reward structure balances:
- **Positive reinforcement** for serving passengers
- **Negative feedback** for inefficiency (unused capacity)
- **Cost-awareness** for infrastructure expansion
- **Time-varying difficulty** to prevent exploitation

## 📈 Expected Performance

With proper training (500+ episodes):
- **Random Agent:** ~20-30/100
- **Monte Carlo:** ~40-55/100
- **Q-Learning:** ~45-60/100
- **Actor-Critic:** ~50-70/100 (best)

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **State space explosion** for tabular methods (discretization needed)
2. **Long training times** for Actor-Critic (neural network)
3. **Sparse reward signal** in some scenarios
4. **Stochastic environment** makes learning challenging

## 🔬 Future Improvements

- [ ] Add reward normalization wrapper
- [ ] Implement PPO/SAC for better performance
- [ ] Add action masking for invalid actions
- [ ] Create vectorized environment for parallel training
- [ ] Add more sophisticated state discretization
- [ ] Implement curriculum learning
